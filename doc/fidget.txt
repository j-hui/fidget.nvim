INSTALLATION                                 *fidget-fidget.nvim-installation*

Install this plugin using your favorite plugin manager. For example, using
vim-plug <https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug>:

>vim
    Plug 'j-hui/fidget.nvim'
<

Make sure the plugin installed (e.g., run `:PlugInstall` if using vim-plug).
After the plugin is loaded (e.g., after `plug#end()` for vim-plug), call its
`setup` function (in Lua):

>lua
    require"fidget".setup{}
<

`setup` takes a table of |fidget-options| as its parameter, used to configure
the plugin.


CONCEPTS                                         *fidget-fidget.nvim-concepts*

This section summarizes the vocabulary used by this plugin and its
documentation to describe relevant concepts, and clarifies the relationship
between those concepts.

A **task** is a particular job that is completed in the background. Examples
include indexing a project, linting a module, or formatting a file.

A task’s **message** describes its status.

A **fidget** (a pun on "widget") represents an entity that performs a
collection of tasks. For now, this plugin only supports fidgets that represent
LSP servers. A fidget may perform multiple tasks concurrently.

A fidget’s **spinner** is an icon shown next next to the fidget’s name, for
purely aesthetic purposes.

This plugin displays the progress of tasks grouped by fidget. For example, if
there are two fidgets, `fidgetA` and `fidgetB`, with tasks `taskA1`, `taskA2`
and `taskB1`, `taskB2`, respectively, they might be displayed as follows:

>
    fidgetA ...
    Started [taskA1]
    Ongoing [taskA2]
    fidgetB ...
    Completed [taskB1]
    Ongoing [taskB2]
<

Each fidget’s spinner is `...`; the tasks’ messages are `Started`,
`Ongoing`, and `Completed`.

<


TEXT.SPINNER

Animation shown in fidget title when its tasks are ongoing. Can either be the
name of one of the predefined |fidget-fidget-spinners|, or an array of strings
representing each frame of the animation.

Type: `string` or `[string]` (default: `"pipe"`)


TEXT.DONE

Text shown in fidget title when all its tasks are completed, i.e., it has no
more tasks.

Type: `string` (default: `"✔"`)


TEXT.COMMENCED

Message shown when a task starts.

Type: `string` (default: `"Started"`)


TEXT.COMPLETED

Message shown when a task completes.

Type: `string` (default: `"Completed"`)


ALIGN.BOTTOM

Whether to align fidgets along the bottom edge of each buffer.

Type: `bool` (default: `true`)


ALIGN.RIGHT

Whether to align fidgets along the right edge of each buffer. Setting this to
`false` is not recommended, since that will lead to the fidget text being
regularly overlaid on top of buffer text (which is supported but unsightly).

Type: `bool` (default: `true`)


WINDOW.RELATIVE

Whether to position the window relative to the current window, or the editor.
Valid values are `"win"` or `"editor"`.

Type: `string` (default: `"win"`)


WINDOW.BLEND

The value to use for `&winblend` for the window, to adjust transparency.

Type: `number` (default: `100`)


WINDOW.ZINDEX

The value to use for `zindex` (see `:h nvim_open_win`) for the window.

Type: `number` (default: `nil`)


WINDOW.BORDER

The value to use for the window `border` (see `:h nvim_open_win`), to adjust
the Fidget window border style.

Type: `string` (default: `"none"`)


TIMER.SPINNER_RATE

Duration of each frame of the spinner animation, in ms. Set to `0` to only use
the first frame of the spinner animation.

Type: `number` (default: `125`)


TIMER.FIDGET_DECAY

How long to continue showing a fidget after all its tasks are completed, in ms.
Set to `0` to clear each fidget as soon as all its tasks are completed; set to
any negative number to keep it around indefinitely (not recommended).

Type: `number` (default: `2000`)


TIMER.TASK_DECAY

How long to continue showing a task after it is complete, in ms. Set to `0` to
clear each task as soon as it is completed; set to any negative number to keep
it around until its fidget is cleared.

Type: `number` (default: `1000`)


FMT.MAX_MESSAGES

The maximum number of messages you want stacked at any given time.  
Set this to a higher number if you want to display more messages, for chatty lsp
servers this might cover up a large area of the window.

Type: `number` (default: `2`)

FMT.LEFTPAD

Whether to right-justify the text in a fidget box by left-padding it with
spaces. Recommended when |fidget-align.right| is `true`.

Type: `bool` (default: `true`)


FMT.STACK_UPWARDS

Whether the list of tasks should grow upward in a fidget box. With this set to
`true`, fidget titles tend to jump around less.

Type: `bool` (default: `true`)


FMT.MAX_WIDTH

Maximum width of the fidget box; longer lines are truncated. If this option is
set to `0`, then the width of the fidget box will be limited only by that of
the focused window/editor (depending on |fidget-window.relative|).

Type: `number` (default: `0`)


FMT.FIDGET

Function used to format the title of a fidget. Given two arguments: the name of
the fidget, and the current frame of the spinner. Returns the formatted fidget
title.

Type: `(string, string) -> string` (default: something sane)


FMT.TASK

Function used to format the status of each task. Given three arguments: the
name of the task, its message, and its progress as a percentage. Returns the
formatted task status. If this value is false, don’t show tasks at all.

Type: `(string, string, string) -> string` (default: something sane)


SOURCES.SOURCE_NAME

Options for fidget source with name `SOURCE_NAME`.

Type: `{options}` (default: see individual per-source options)


SOURCES.SOURCE_NAME.IGNORE

Disable fidgets from `SOURCE_NAME`.

Type: `bool` (default: `false`)


DEBUG.LOGGING

Whether to enable logging, for debugging. The log is written to
`~/.local/share/nvim/fidget.nvim.log`.

Type: `bool` (default: `false`)


DEBUG.STRICT

Whether this plugin should follow a strict interpretation of the LSP protocol,
e.g., notifications missing the `kind` field.

Setting this to `false` (the default) will likely lead to more sensible
behavior with non-conforming language servers, but may mask server misbehavior.

Type: `bool` (default: `false`)


COMMANDS                                         *fidget-fidget.nvim-commands*


FIDGETCLOSE

Closes ongoing fidget(s) (i.e., it has incomplete tasks), removing its spinner.
Arguments can be given to close specific fidgets, e.g.,:

>
    :FidgetClose null-ls rust-analyzer
<

If no arguments are provided, all sources will be closed.

This command is primarily useful for clearing the UI when tasks appear to be
unresponsive (see https://github.com/j-hui/fidget.nvim/issues/28). Note that
this command does not silence a source: subsequent notifications will restart
the fidget.


HIGHLIGHTS                                     *fidget-fidget.nvim-highlights*

This plugin uses the following highlights to display the fidgets, and can be
overridden to customize how fidgets look.

For example, to make the `FidgetTitle` blue, add the following to your .vimrc:

>vim
    highlight FidgetTitle ctermfg=110 guifg=#6cb6eb
<

Or to link <hi-link> it to the `Variable` highlight group:

>vim
    highlight link FidgetTitle Variable
<


FIDGETTITLE

Highlight used for the title of a fidget.

Default: linked to hl-Title <hl-Title>


FIDGETTASK

Highlight used for the body (the tasks) of a fidget.

Default: linked to hl-LineNr <hl-LineNr>


SPINNERS                                         *fidget-fidget.nvim-spinners*

The |fidget-text.spinner| option recognizes the following spinner pattern
names:

>
    dots
    dots_negative
    dots_snake
    dots_footsteps
    dots_hop
    line
    pipe
    dots_ellipsis
    dots_scrolling
    star
    flip
    hamburger
    grow_vertical
    grow_horizontal
    noise
    dots_bounce
    triangle
    arc
    circle
    square_corners
    circle_quarters
    circle_halves
    dots_toggle
    box_toggle
    arrow
    zip
    bouncing_bar
    bouncing_ball
    clock
    earth
    moon
    dots_pulse
    meter
<

See <lua/fidget/spinners.lua> of this plugin’s source code to see how each
animation is defined.


TROUBLESHOOTING                           *fidget-fidget.nvim-troubleshooting*

If in doubt, file an issue on <https://github.com/j-hui/fidget.nvim/issues>.


I SET UP THIS PLUGIN BUT NOTHING APPEARS! ~

This plugin automatically installs its progress handler, but that may be
overwritten by other plugins by the time you arrive at the text buffer. For
example, if you also use nvim-lua/lsp-status.nvim
<https://github.com/nvim-lua/lsp-status.nvim>, its `register_progress` function
will overwrite Fidget’s progress handler.

You can check whether Fidget’s progress handler is correctly installed using
`is_installed`. For example, to do this interactively, run the following Vim
command:

>vim
    :lua print(require"fidget".is_installed())
<

If it isn’t installed, make sure that it works by manually calling `setup`,
e.g.,:

>vim
    :lua require"fidget".setup{}
<

If that works, then you need to make sure other plugins aren’t clashing with
this one, or at least call Fidget’s `setup` function after the other plugins
are done setting up.


MY PROGRESS NOTIFICATIONS ARE BEING CUT SHORT. ~

Some language servers may send long progress messages that cannot be nicely
displayed on a single line. These messages are forcibly truncated to the width
of the focused editor window or 99 characters, whichever is shorter.

The way truncation is implemented is not sensitive to the format of each line,
potentially leading to lines with unmatched brackets:

>
    Message [long title...
<

If you would like to to avoid this behavior, you can override the
|fidget-fmt.task| handler with one that truncates the message/title before
formatting:

>lua
    {
      fmt = {
        task =
          function(task_name, message, percentage)
            if #message > 42 then
              message = string.format("%.39s...", message)
            end
            if #task_name > 42 then
              task_name = string.format("%.39s...", task_name)
            end
            return string.format(
              "%s%s [%s]",
              message,
              percentage and string.format(" (%s%%)", percentage) or "",
              task_name
            )
          end,
      },
    }
<

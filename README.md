# fidget.nvim

Extensible UI for Neovim notifications and LSP progress messages.

  <summary>Demo setup</summary>

*Note that this demo may not always reflect the exact behavior of the latest release.*

This screen recording was taken as I opened a Rust file I'm working on,
triggering `rust-analyzer` to send me some LSP progress messages.

As those messages are ongoing, I trigger some notifications with the following:

```lua
local fidget = require("fidget")

vim.keymap.set("n", "A", function()
  fidget.notify("This is from fidget.notify().")
end)

vim.keymap.set("n", "B", function()
  fidget.notify("This is also from fidget.notify().", vim.log.levels.WARN)
end)

vim.keymap.set("n", "C", function()
  fidget.notify("fidget.notify() supports annotations...", nil, { annote = "MY NOTE", key = "foobar" })
end)

vim.keymap.set("n", "D", function()
  fidget.notify(nil, vim.log.levels.ERROR, { annote = "YOUR AD HERE", key = "foobar" })
  fidget.notify("... and overwriting notifications.", vim.log.levels.WARN, { annote = "bottom text" })
end)
```

(I use normal mode keymaps to avoid going into ex mode, which would pause Fidget
rendering and make the demo look glitchy...)

Visible elements:

-   Terminal + font: [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) + [Comic Shanns Mono](https://github.com/shannpersand/comic-shanns)
-   Editor: [Neovim v0.9.4](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/tree/v0.9.4)
-   Theme: [folke/twilight.nvim](https://github.com/folke/twilight.nvim)
-   Status line: [nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim)
-   Color columns: `:set colorcolumn=81,121,+1,+2` (sorry)

### Why?

Fidget is an unintrusive window in the corner of your editor that manages
its own lifetime. Its goals are:

- to provide a UI for Neovim's [`$/progress`][lsp-progress] handler
- to provide a configurable [`vim.notify()`][vim-notify] backend
- to support basic ASCII animations (Fidget spinners!) to indicate signs of life
- to be easy to configure, sane to maintain, and fun to hack on

There's only so much information one can stash into the status line. Besides,
who doesn't love a little bit of terminal eye candy, as a treat?

[vim-notify]: https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua.html#vim.notify()

## Quickstart

### Requirements

Fidget requires Neovim v0.8.0+.

If you would like to see progress notifications, you must have configured Neovim
with an LSP server that uses the [`$/progress`][lsp-progress] handler. For an
up-to-date list of LSP servers this plugin is known to work with, see
[this pinned issue](https://github.com/j-hui/fidget.nvim/issues/17).


### Installation

Install this plugin using your favorite plugin manager.

See the [documentation](doc/fidget.md) for `setup()` options.

#### [Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
{
  "j-hui/fidget.nvim",
  opts = {
    -- options
  },
}
```

#### [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```vim
Plug 'j-hui/fidget.nvim'
```

Make sure the plugin is installed run `:PlugInstall`.

After the plugin is loaded (e.g., after `plug#end()` for vim-plug), call its
`setup` function (in Lua):

```lua
require("fidget").setup {
  -- options
}
```

## Related Work

[rcarriga/nvim-notify](https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-notify) is first and
foremost a `vim.notify()` backend, and it also supports
[LSP progress notifications](https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-notify/wiki/Usage-Recipes#lsp-status-updates)
(with the integration seems to have been packaged up in
[mrded/nvim-lsp-notify](https://github.com/mrded/nvim-lsp-notify)).

[vigoux/notifier.nvim](https://github.com/vigoux/notifier.nvim) is
a `vim.notify()` backend that comes with first-class LSP notification support.

[neoclide/coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) provides a nice LSP
progress UI in the status line, which first inspired my desire to have this
feature for nvim-lsp.

[arkav/lualine-lsp-progress](https://github.com/arkav/lualine-lsp-progress) was
the original inspiration for Fidget, and funnels LSP progress messages into
[nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim).
I once borrowed some of its code (though much of that code has since been
rewritten).

[nvim-lua/lsp-status.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/lsp-status.nvim) also
supports showing progress text, though it requires some configuration to
integrate that into their status line.

### Acknowledgements

Most of the Fidget spinner patterns were adapted from the npm package
[sindresorhus/cli-spinners](https://github.com/sindresorhus/cli-spinners).
